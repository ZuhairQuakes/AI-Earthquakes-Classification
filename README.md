This project analyzes big earthquakes with the help of Neural Networks and Explainable AI, exploring their behaviour and reasons behind their occurrence, classifying big and small events, and their regional preferences. Using PyTorch, sklearn, and data visualization, the project uncovers insights into what drives big earthquakes in some settings while small earthquakes in others, forecasting potential regions at risk and controlling factors.
