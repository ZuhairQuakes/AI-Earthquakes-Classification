## Data-Driven Earthquake Hazard Mapping Using PyTorch Neural Networks and Sklearn Tools

This project leverages Machine Learning and Explainable AI (XAI) to identify mechanisms driving megathrust fault seismicity (large earthquakes, Mw > 8.0) across global subduction zones. The goal is to classify fault segments based on earthquake magnitude using ML and to determine which geophysical features are most influential.

I integrated diverse datasets (geophysical, kinematic, and dynamic features) for training a neural network to classify earthquake-prone regions. I applied Layerwise Relevance Propagation (LRP) to uncover the most significant features driving predictions, enhancing model interpretability.

Through this project, I developed skills in handling large-scale geospatial data, designing robust ML pipelines, and deriving actionable insights.

This methodology is transferable to domains like predictive analytics, risk assessment, and spatial data scienceâ€”solving complex problems through machine learning and explainable AI.
